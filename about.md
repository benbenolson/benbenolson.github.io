This is a small blog written by Ben Olson, in the course of his PhD candidacy
at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where he focuses on heterogeneous
memory systems research.  The goal of this blog is to avoid others having the
same bugs/issues that he's encountered and spent so much time figuring out and
fixing.
